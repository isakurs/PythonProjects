Hangman, FindWord, and Acronym Requirements:
nltk

Install nltk
Step 1. go to command prompt and run this command:
	pip install nltk

If that gave ssl errors try this command:
	pip install nltk --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org

Step 2. run WordDownloads.py


The Code:

Acronym.py
This is just a silly thing that makes acronyms out of any words you put in.

FindWord.py
This is something that will check for a word in the nltk words corpus (Don't ask me what that means, I dont really know) and then will try to find a definition for that word.

Gambling.py
This is a very inefficient slot machine I made while at school.

GuessNumber.py
This is a number guessing game with 4 levels of difficulty.

Hangman.py
This is an unreasonable game of hangman using the nltk words corpus as its list of words. Some words include: manzanilla, dol, and pinyl. It also tries to provide a definition for these words.

Pass.py
This is a password generator. Simple as that.
